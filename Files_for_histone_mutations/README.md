The repository contains two histone cancer mutation datasets and matches them to different interaction networks, including histone-histone interaction(HHI) networks, histone-DNA interaction(HDI) networks and histone-partner interaction(HPI) networks.

You can browse the following folders:

  1.[combined_histone_cancer_mutation_set.csv](combined_histone_cancer_mutation_set.csv):Data of combined histone cancer mutation set including 7974 histone cancer mutation data.
